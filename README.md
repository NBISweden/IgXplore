# Running the tests

First, it is recommended that you enable the IgDiscover cache,
which you can do the following way:

    echo "use_cache: true" > ~/.config/igdiscover.conf

See <http://docs.igdiscover.se/en/stable/guide.html#caching-of-igblast-results-and-of-merged-reads>
for details. With the cache enabled, the tests run much faster.
