# Experiment description table
#
# Required columns:
#
# - id: An identifier
# - database: Path to a directory that contains V.fasta, D.fasta and J.fasta
# - reads: Path to single-end or paired-end FASTA or FASTQ files (can be gzip-compressed)
#   For paired-end data, put a '?' into the file name. It will be replaced
#   with '1' and '2' to generate the actual R1 and R2 file names.
#
# Additional columns are treated as metadata columns
# ("sample" and "timepoint" in this example)
